# shakespeare

Attached is my Python project with machine learning. Running the sonnet.py, iambic.py, and shakespeare.py files will have the code read 
all of Shakespeare major works. After which the code is taught to those works and write it's own in analyzing Shakespeare's writing style.
From that, the code writes a new series of lines in the sonnet.txt, iambic.txt, and shakespeare.txt files. Each running of the Python files
will output a new line of text. So in which, the code continues Shakespeare's work.
